# FST344 Optimization Comparison Report

## Original Sequence (NM_013409.3 CDS)
- Length: 1034 bp
- GC Content: 53.8%
- CpG Dinucleotides: 34 (6.58%)
- Codons: 344

## Optimized Sequence
- Length: 1032 bp  
- GC Content: 61.1%
- CpG Dinucleotides: 43 (8.33%)
- Codons: 344

## Improvements
- GC Content Change: +7.4%
- CpG Reduction: -9 dinucleotides (-26.5% reduction)
- Protein Sequence: Identical

## Expected Benefits
- Reduced immunogenicity (fewer CpG motifs)
- Improved AAV packaging efficiency
- Enhanced expression in mammalian cells
- Better codon adaptation for human expression

## Next Steps
1. Validate protein folding using AlphaFold
2. Test expression in HEK293T cells
3. Package in AAV vectors for in vivo testing
